            <p>The Diversity Working Group was founded in 2019 by Tomoko Shida, Moska Rokay, Renee Saucier, Stefanie Martin and Tam Rayan, with the hopes of evoking change and creating community at the University of Toronto's iSchool.</p>
            <p>Our group works to improve the experiences of Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Colour (BIPOC) at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information through workshops, reading groups, special events, and advocacy work with faculty and university administration.</p>

              <p><b>Representation</b></p>
              <p>Concerns expressed by BIPOC students have often fallen on deaf ears at the Faculty of Information. As indicated in our 2020 Report on DEI at the iSchool, the faculty has a history of ignoring the needs of racialized students. Our group aims to give a voice for those at the margins through direct advocacy.</p>

              <p><b>Recognition</b></p>
              <p>
                We aim to help all students feel recognized and ‚Äúat home‚Äù at the iSchool. Through things like the development of educational resources and hosting culturally specific events, we hope to foster a space where BIPOC iSchool students feel safe, supported, and  empowered.</p></div>

              <p><b>Redistribution</b></p>
              <p>
                A major barrier that emerging BIPOC information professionals face is the lack of resources and support available. We want to help alleviate this by doing what we can to open up access to resources and opportunities for racialized students. Mentorship is one of our major focus areas in this domain.</p></div>
